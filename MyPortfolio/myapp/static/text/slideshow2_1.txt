Somewhere in Himachal Pradesh, India*****
I still have quite vivid memories of this day.
It was a warm day, clear skies and the perfect weather to go trekking.
This picture was taken somewhere on the trail to Indrahar Pass summit at an altitude of aprrox.3500 meters.
The view made my day.
It was an experience of a lifetime.
